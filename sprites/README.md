# Sprite Uploading

Please make sure that the sprite you are uploading meetings the required guidelines in the main README.

## PR

Please make a PR to make sure the sprite meets requirements and that the team has agreed to add to the game.

> Note: A sprite does not have to be perfect and can be WIP for safe keeping. PR drafts as a WIP are also welcome.

## Directory Structure

Please try to adhere to the directory structure below. You can also see `/_example_PC_ninja` as a reference.

1. `/sprites/` (this directory)
2. `/role_name of sprite/` (eg. PC_ninja, NPC_trader, BOSS_spider)
3. `/name of action/` (eg. idle, running, sword_attack)

## Sprite File

- Naming can be whatever makes sense for the sprite, perhaps taking into account the directory context
- `.png` / `.PNG` formats only
- If sprite is an animation, please use a sprite sheet (no `.gif`)
